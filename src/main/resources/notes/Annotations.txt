Some Important annotations and points
-- Table Related Annotation --
@Entity : To inform hibernate to create and treat as database table. (It is mandatory annotations)
@Table(name = "emp_details") : if we don't specify this annotation, hibernate automatically creats table with className(in lowe case)
, if we want explicitly to define the name of table Use this annotations. (Optional annotation)

 @Id : For every table we have primary key , we have to use this annotation for mention as primary key.((It is mandatory annotations)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) : (Optional annotation)
    this generates the id value of the table automatically by increment 1 every time.
@Column(name = "emp_id") : use this annotation to specify name of the column in database(Optional).

Bean : is same as object, but creating and managing , destroying object is taken care by spring.
@Service : To mark this class a  spring to bean , manage and delete object. Use this annotation on top of the class which has business logic.
@Component: IT is same as @Service annotation, but more generic.(A class which contains non-business logic).
@Repository: It is same as above two, but use this on the class which interacts with DB.


@Autowired : The process of injecting  one object into another class.
Example: ClassA need classB object , then spring will pull classB object from container and injecting into the classA.
It can be done in three ways:
1.Constructor Dependency Injection (It is most preferable)
2.Field level Dependency Injection.
3.Setter level Dependency Injection.

IOC: the process creating and managing and deleting the object is taken care by spring itself.
All objects are created at the time of application start and stored in Ioc container.

@RestController: This entry of request that contains api's. this returns json data.
@RestController:  @Controller + @ResponseBody
Example :  @GetMapping("/get")
              public String test() {
                return "Hello";
              }

    output = Hello

@Controller: This is same RestController but it return one html page.

Example: @GetMapping("/get")
            public String test() {
              return "Hello";
            }
            // it returns Hello.html page
