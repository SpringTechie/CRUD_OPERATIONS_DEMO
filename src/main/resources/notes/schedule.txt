Scheduling in SpringBoot.
Scheduler : If we want run any task for every onr hr or 5 secs or every day we need have to create scheduler job.

To Enable Scheduling in spring we need to annotate @EnableScheduling on top of main class.
Now create a class and write a method inside that class and annotate @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000) on top of that method.

1.FixedRate: Executes the task at a fixed interval from the start time of previous execution regardless of how long the
previous task took.
@Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000,initialDelay = 10000)
Use Case: Useful when you need tasks to run at consistency frequency.

2.FixedDelay:
Execute the task with fixed delay after the previous task complete.
UseCase: Useful when you want to ensure a delay after task completion.
@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000,initialDelay = 10000)

initialDelay : While starting the application it force job to wait for some time.
