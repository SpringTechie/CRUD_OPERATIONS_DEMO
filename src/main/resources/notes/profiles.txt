Profiles in SpringBoot.
1.profiles allows you to configure diffrent environments by defining specific property files.
Implementation:
Now create diff configuration files for each env.
application-dev.properties
application-stage.properties
application-prod.properties

Now define env specific properties.
How to activate env?
In default application properties add this property.
spring.profiles.active=<env_name>

Internal Working of profiles.
When application starts spring will checks weather any profile is activated or not.
if any profile is active then it will read properties from that prropety file else fall back to default (application.properties file).
Example:
I have defined server.port in dev profile , and activated this profile , now application will load values form dev profile.
